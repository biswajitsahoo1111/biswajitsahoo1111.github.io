      <description>Almost every reader would have seen systems of linear equations from their high school days. Whether they liked it or not is a separate story. But, in all likelihood, they would have solved these equations by gradually removing variables one by one by substitution. In this way, three equations with three variables(or unknowns) gets transformed to two equations in two variables and one further step of reduction gives us an equation with only one variable which is readily solvable.</description>
