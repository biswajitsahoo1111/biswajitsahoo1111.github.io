# Personal Website

This is my personal website hosted by github. The website can be accessed at [https://biswajitsahoo1111.github.io/](https://biswajitsahoo1111.github.io/).

I had previously hosted my website using netlify. That site is still active and can be accessed at [https://biswajitsahoo1111.netlify.com/](https://biswajitsahoo1111.netlify.com/).

Both the sites are identical. In the long run I will keep one and deactivate the other. But for the time being, both are active and contents will be added simultaneously to both.
